The appsettings.json file is an application configuration file used to store configuration settings such as 
database connections strings, any application scope global variables, etc.

by the use of IConfiguration service interface, we can call the key-value pair that is stored int the appsettings.json file into the Startup class
to use it in the application 

There are multiple configuration sources available in the asp.net core application:
        ->appsettings.json : 5
        ->appsettings.{env}.json(like development) : 4
        -> User secrets : 3
        ->Environmental variables(launchsettings.json) : 2
        ->Command line arguments : 1

        If the configuration key has the same name in different config sources, then it will get overwrite by the high precesedent source.
        ex:
            if appsettings.json has key -> MyCustome key and appsettings.development.json also has the same key,
            appsettings.development.json will overwrite the appsettings.json key value
