The logging providers stores in the logs, except for the console that displays the log.
In the program.cs file, we have configured log provider:
            ClearProviders -> Will remove all the logging providers available.
            AddConsole -> Will add console provider service.
In the controller file, we have called in the ILogger object which is an in built logging provider in asp.net core.
We have called the ILogger using dependency injection.

The Logging property has log levels:
        Trace - 0
        Debug - 1
        Information - 2
        Warning - 3
        Error - 4
        Critical - 5
        None - 6
We can set the log levels under appsettings.json file

Each log can have a specific event id. default it is [0].
