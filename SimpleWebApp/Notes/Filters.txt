Filters allow the code to run before and after some particular actions in the request processing pipeline.
Filters avoid duplicating code and consolidating functionality into single page.

Sample code
------------

1. Custom filter class

    To create a custom filter, we need to implement an interface.
    If using action filter, we need to implement IActionFilter interface.
        This has two methods:
            OnActionExecuting
            OnActionExectued
    Check MySampleActionFilterAttribute file for the sample code.

    To register the filter created to aspcore pipeline, go to Startup.cs class.

2.Startup.cs

    Register the filter under ConfigureServices method.
    Within AddControllers method, using option we can register the filters.(Look into Startup class)
